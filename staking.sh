Your wallet has now been set up for staking, please send the coins you wish to stake to ${STAKINGADDRESS}. Once your wallet is synced your coins should begin staking automatically.

To check on the status of your staked coins you can run "bulwark-cli getstakingstatus" and "bulwark-cli getinfo". To see when you receive your rewards from your QT wallet, you can also add a watch-only address from your debug console using "importaddress ${STAKINGADDRESS} StakingRewards".

You can also import the private key for this address in to your QT wallet using the BIP38 tool under settings, just enter the information here with the password you chose at the start.

${BIP38}

Finally, to send the coins elsewhere if you no longer wish to stake them, use "bulwark-cli sendfrom ${STAKINGADDRESS} <Address You Want To Send To> <Amount>" which will return the transaction hash.

All of these instruction will be available from the Github page, and in the Bulwark Discord/Telegram on request!
